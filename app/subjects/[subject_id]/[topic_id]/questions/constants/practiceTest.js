    question:
      "What is the difference between mitosis and meiosis and where do they occur?",
    answer:
      "Mitosis is a process of cell division that results in two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell, occurring in somatic cells. Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell, occurring in germ cells.",

    answer:
      "DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. It consists of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix structure. The function of DNA is to store and transmit genetic information.",

      "What is the process of photosynthesis and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. It is important because it is the primary source of oxygen in the atmosphere and it provides the energy that sustains almost all life on Earth.",

    question:
      "Explain Newton's laws of motion.",
    answer:
      "Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. The first law (law of inertia) states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. The second law (F=ma) states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The third law (action and reaction) states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",

    question:
      "Discuss the differences between exothermic and endothermic reactions.",
    answer:
      "Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings in the form of heat, light, or sound. Endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings, usually in the form of heat. Exothermic reactions typically involve the formation of bonds with lower energy than the reactants, while endothermic reactions involve the breaking of bonds with higher energy than the reactants.",

    question:
      "What is the periodic table and how is it organized?",
    answer:
      "The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organized by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties. Elements with similar chemical properties are grouped together in columns called groups or families, while elements with the same number of valence electrons are found in the same group.",
